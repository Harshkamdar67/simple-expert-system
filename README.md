# Plant Disease Diagnosis Expert System

Welcome to the Plant Disease Diagnosis Expert System! This system is a simple implementation of a rule based expert system to diagnose plant diseases based on symptoms provided by the user.

## How to Use

### 1. Setup

Before using the system, ensure you have the following:

- Python installed on your system.
- A knowledge base file (`knowledge_base.json`) containing rules for diagnosing plant diseases.

### 2. Installation

There's no specific installation required. Simply download the provided Python script (`diagnosis_system.py`) along with the knowledge base file (`knowledge_base.json`).

### 3. Usage

To diagnose a plant disease, follow these steps:

1. **Load the Knowledge Base**: The system will automatically load the knowledge base from the provided JSON file.
2. **Provide Symptoms**: Enter your plant's symptoms and their severities when prompted. For example, you might enter `yellow_leaves:0.7, stunted_growth:0.8`.
3. **View Diagnosis**: Based on the provided symptoms, the system will output the most likely diagnosis along with its confidence level.

## Understanding the Code

- The `diagnosis_system.py` script contains the main functionality.
- It loads the knowledge base, processes user input, performs diagnosis calculations, and presents the diagnosis to the user.
- Comments within the code explain each step and function in detail.
